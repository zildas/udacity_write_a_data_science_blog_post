You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.","What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if you leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that ","Convenient bus stops are just down the block, if you're headed downtown or further afield to explore.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

Belltown is also an easy walk, just on the other side of Seattle Center - I walk to work in Belltown and it usually takes me about 25 minutes.

They're usually less expensive than taxis, but you'll need to download the apps to your smartphone in order to use them. You can get your first ride for free up to $20 by using the code uvgmm for Uber or libby111 for Lyft! Bus: There are bus stops all over - the closest ones are less than 5 mins walking. The cost is $2.50, cash only. Monorail/Light Rail: The monorail at the Space Needle is 15 mins walking, and that will take you to 5th x Pine downtown for $2 (cash only). From there you can cross the street to the light rail station for quick and cheap access to the stadiums, Amtrak station, and airport. The light rail kiosks accept both cash and credit cards. Bike: Seattle now has a bike share program called Pronto. 24 hour passes are $8, and 3-day passes are $16.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

I've been a Queen Anne resident for a frighteningly long time - 26 years this fall. I raised two kids here, and even though one is 22 and away at college and the other a senior in high school, they both still swear they'll live on Queen Anne. I commute over the bridge to the east side to work as an attorney for a ""large technology company,"" but am a Seattleite through and through. It's a big house, and my daughter and I would be happy to share part of it. We'd be pretty chill hosts, mostly would just do our own thing without much interaction with our occasional guests, though we'd be pleased to have you and show you the ropes.

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels, if you are curious or would like to know more about us, Please Please ask us, we are more than willing to share!

Thank you for takig the time to read about us, we hope to meet you in the future!

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

The character of the neighbourhood has always been a bit rough and tumble, influenced heavily by the Scandinavians and others who came here to build, repair and work the boats that catch most of the US's salmon.

But things change, and the gentrification that's morphed other formerly blue collar neighbourhoods, like Brooklyn, NY, has landed here in Ballard, too. Great cafes, restaurants (some of the best new places to eat in the US), shops, coffee roasters and beer makers have all been popping up and helping define the new Old Ballard as smart, hip, well-heeled and discriminating.

Ballard used to be a small town independent of Seattle, so it offers all the entertainment and amenities of a city in one neighborhood! Micro-brews, restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques. It even has a jazz club with music almost every night of the week.  On Sundays downtown Ballard transforms into a Farmers Market with local food and products being peddled.   My favorite Ballard attraction is the Ballard Locks. From June to October you can watch the great salmon migration at the locks as they jump the fish ladder. Year round you can watch the boats move through the ship canal as they head out into the Sound. The Locks host various cultural events in their botanical garden during the summer, such as music and tours. Events are free to the public.","We have a small, cuddly dog named Giacomo.

We are Yedida and Vincent. 

We are a newly married couple with a healthy curiosity for travel and culture. For our honeymoon we backpacked around the world in 10 unforgettable months. We came back to the states to attend Graduate School at the UW and put down roots here in gorgeous Seattle. I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand. 

We enjoy cooking, being outdoors, exercising, reading and dancing (well, that's just me!). Travel remains our number one love. I remain loosely connected to the international community through my work as an Italian instructor. 

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home. 

We have a roommate, Kevin, who occupies the basement floor of the house. Kevin is an accomplished pastry chef and works a lot in the summer. You will catch him in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of yummy treats for us!
